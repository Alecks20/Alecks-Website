        <p class="box-text">
            The original landing page for the a3d.pro domain, one of my first experiences doing proper web development and I hated it. It got prtty much neglected by me and I barely worked on it, the website has a horrible design with almost no features and the majority of the code was either chatpgt or google bard/gemini

        <p class="box-text">
            This site used to be deployed to atomic2ds.github.io, now its running on Cloudflare pages. It was a pretty horrible layout and design with nothing on it. Most of this was also made using ai chatbots. You can also see that the background doesn't properly fit or stretch so if you make your window too small or a weird size theres big white bars
