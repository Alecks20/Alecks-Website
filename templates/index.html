            <p class="card-text">I'm a self-taught developer located in Asia Pacific who is skilled in python and is just getting started with html and css. I'm passionate about computers and commited to making something that changes the internet for the better.</p>

            <p class="card-text">My stengths are definitely in server management, infrastructure and stuff like the Cloud. I also enjoy programming in Python, HTMl/CSS and im starting to learn JavaScript now. I've been programming for only about a year.</p>
            
            <p class="card-text">As much as I enjoy computers, internet and networking. I'm only in my early teenage years, not fully consistent and more interested at making cherished memories with my friends at this point in time.</p>
