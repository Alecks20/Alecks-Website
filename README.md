## About this project
- This is the 2nd revision of the a3d.pro website, im enjoying a lot more this time
- I needed an all in one website/app that could display everything like a blog, projects and about page
- All the code is open-source for maximum transparency so you can see that your data is not being harvested

## How I collect analytics
- I run a self-hosted instance of Umami which collects information like your location, device type and software.
- We keep this data as secure as possible by isolating it in its own environment
- In the event of a data breach so little data is collected that you wouldn't need to worry
