# A3D Website

- This is the second revision of my a3d.pro website, im enjoying it a lot more this time because im actually trying to learn more about how html/css works instead of just using ai chatbots. 

- I built this because I needed an all-in-one solution for hosting my blog, about me and projects page. I keep this open-source so I can give other people inspiration and also provide maximum transparency so you can verify im not harvesting your data.

- To collect analytics I run a self-hosted instance of Umami which collects very little information about you and is built purely to preserve privacy. Even in the event of a data breach so little data is collected that you wouldn't need to worry
