## My Personal Website
- ### [🐳 Production Deployment](https://a3d.pro)
- ### [📦 Public Analytics Page](https://umami.a3d.pro/share/nI1FDSuCssQJXF6h/a3d.pro)

## How I collect analytics
- I run a self-hosted instance of Umami which collects information like your location, device type and software.
- We keep this data as secure as possible by isolating it in its own environment
- In the event of a data breach so little data is collected that you wouldn't need to worry
