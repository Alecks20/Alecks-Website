title: The end of Cloudy bot
date: 2024-03-30
description: After exactly a year of development, its finally time to move onto bigger things. I am going to move on from bot development and work on much cooler and more enjoyable projects.
slug: ending-cloudy

### Why its happening
If im honest, I don't enjoy working on this bot anymore and I lack the motivation to continue building new features. On top of this I recieve no funding for the bot and have to pay for its infrastructure out of my own pocket.


### What im gonna do now
I'm going to move on to new and more enjoyable projects either in the game dev world or in web dev. I will always remember Cloudy as one of my first ever successful programming projects. Starting off as Panda-py, then turning into Bulbasaur, and eventually ending up as Cloudy, I will never forget the long nights I spent working on this bot until 3 O'clock in the morning.

### Whats happening to its assets (Project Tracker, Top.gg Page, etc)
I am going to either delete or private every single thing I have connected to this bot, except for the repository which houses all of the code for the bot, that will stay open source for as long as possible

### Why delete everything
It will stop me from getting motivation and just starting back up again in bot dev which would be lazy of me, im trying to learn new stuff now. It also makes the change feel more major and brings more attention to it so I can ensure everyone who should know about it knows about it.

You can see all of my projects on the projects page on this website, make sure to check that out often for new ones

**Have a good rest of your day/night.**
