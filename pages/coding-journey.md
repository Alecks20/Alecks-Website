slug: coding-journey

## Introduction
I have been programming for only about a year at this point, so far im really enjoying it. The pace, flexibility, freedom and much more makes me enjoy doing it over stuff like gaming. At this point im only 14 years old still in high school (Year 9) and im not sure what part of the tech industry to go into and get a job in. Currently im looking at either software engineer, network engineer or cloud engineer.

## My first projects
The first thing I built with code was a Discord bot, a discord.py 2.0 bot if you wanna be specific. It was just a simple little project I wanted to work on because I thought it would be cool having my own discord bot. It was at that point that I started to love the flexibility and freedom you got with programming your own stuff.

## Year of little progresssion
For about a year I just kept developing my Discord bot with almost no progression or effort to learn more programming languages or concepts, I will give myself credit though I was learning a little bit of stuff from it such as:

- Learning how Python classes work and how to make them
- Learning how to deploy my app using Docker and Docker Compose
- Learning how to integrate a mongodb database into my server and also deploy and connect one using Docker

## Current State (Learning HTML/CSS)
Now we are in the present, and im learning how to write and code websites using HTML and CSS, I also want to learn Javascript so I can enhance my websites even further, im learning most stuff from freecodecamp, chatgpt/google gemini and also just playing around with stuff myself.

## My Checklist
### Current Goals
- Learn how to code in Python (For networking and Discord bots) (In Progress since 2023)
- Learn how to code basic html and css (In progress since 2024)
- Learn how to code in javascript to enhance my websites and make them more alive (Not Started)
### Future Goals
- Learn how to build games using C# in unity and make assets
- Learn how to build ios and android apps

Im just getting started at this point, theres still much more to come and im still young

Have a good rest of your day/night
